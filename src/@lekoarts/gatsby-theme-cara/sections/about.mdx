## About

> I'm a highly motivated and accountable final year university student pursuing a Business Analytics degree with a Data Science minor. I am keen on entering the data field as my minor has evoked my interest in it.
I am based in Calgary but am open to relocating depending on the job. In my free time I enjoy cycling, fishing, hiking and binging on Netflix shows.
